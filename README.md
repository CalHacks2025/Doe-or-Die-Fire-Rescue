# Do or Die: Fire Rescue

Created for [Calgary Hacks 2025](https://calgaryhacks-2025.devpost.com/project-gallery), this game was developed in under 24 hours with the theme of **Collaboration**.

## Game Overview
Do or Die: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game where two players must work together to rescue deer trapped by rapidly spreading wildfires. As the fire expands across the terrain, players must:
- Navigate hazardous zones
- Extinguish flames
- Coordinate their actions to save lives under pressure
