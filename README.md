Do or Die: Fire Rescue
Created for Calgary Hacks 2025, this game was developed in under 24 hours with the theme of Collaboration.
In this cooperative experience, two players must work together to rescue deer trapped by rapidly spreading wildfires. As the fire expands across the terrain, players must navigate hazardous zones, extinguish flames, and coordinate their actions to save lives under pressure.
